### Project and Product names using "IoTDB"

Organizations creating products and projects using Apache IoTDB, along with associated marketing materials, should take care to respect the trademark in “Apache IoTDB” and its logo. Please refer to [ASF Trademarks Guidance](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/) and associated [FAQ](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/faq/) for comprehensive and authoritative guidance on proper usage of ASF trademarks.
It is recommended to not include “IoTDB” in any names to prevent potential trademark issue with the IoTDB project.
As an example, names like “IoTDB BigDataProduct” should not be used, as the name include “IoTDB” in general. The above links, however, describe some exceptions, like for names such as “BigDataProduct, powered by Apache IoTDB” or “BigDataProduct for Apache IoTDB”. In summary, any names contain "Apache IoTDB" as a whole are acceptable.  
A common practice you can take is to create software identifiers (Maven coordinates, module names, etc.) like “iotdb-tool”. These are permitted. Nominative use of trademarks in descriptions is also allowed, as in “BigDataProduct is a subproduct for Apache IoTDB”.

### Companies and Organizations
