# Go API Server for iotdbrest

IoTDB Rest API for Grafana, Prometheus, etc..

## Overview
This server was generated by the [openapi-generator]
(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  
-

To see how to make this your own, look here:

[README](https://openapi-generator.tech)


### How to use:

1. run `mvn generate-sources` under the `openapi` module
2. go to `go-rest` module, fix issues that current openapi-generator causes:
  1. `"mime/multipart"` is forget to be imported in `router.go` (target/gen/iotdbrest/router.go)
  2. `github.com/gorilla/mux` should not be imported in `api_default.go` file. (target/gen/iotdbrest/api_default.go)
  3. A small amount of code needs to be changed in `api_default.go` file. (target/gen/iotdbrest/api_default.go)
    
    In func PostV1PrometheusReceive
    change
    ```
    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&body); err != nil {
    		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
    		return
    }
    ```
    to 
    ```  
    compressed, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)
    reqBuf, _ := snappy.Decode(nil, compressed)
    var req prompb.WriteRequest
    if err := proto.Unmarshal(reqBuf, &req); err != nil {
    	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
    	return
    }
    (*body)["prometheusWriteRequest"] = req
    ```
   
    In func PostV1PrometheusQuery
    change
    ```
    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&body); err != nil {
    		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
    		return
    }
    ...
    //If no error, encode the body and the result code
    EncodeJSONResponse(result.Body, &result.Code, w)
    ```
    to 
    ```  
    compressed, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)
    reqBuf, _ := snappy.Decode(nil, compressed)
    var req prompb.ReadRequest
    if err := proto.Unmarshal(reqBuf, &req); err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }
    (*body)["prometheusReadRequest"] = req
    ...
    //If no error, encode the body and the result code
    w.Write(result.Body.([]byte))
    ```
### Running the server
To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
cd src
go build

windows
./src.exe

linux
./src
```

To run the server in a docker container
```
docker build --network=host -t iotdbrest .
```

Once image is built use
```
docker run --rm -it iotdbrest 
```
