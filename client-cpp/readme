Introduction:
    This module provide an example of how to connect to IoTDB with c++. You need to write your own program by simulating src/SessionExample.cpp

Requirement:
    Using this module requires you to install thrift(0.11.0 or later). Below is the official tutorial of installation:
        http://thrift.apache.org/docs/install/
        
Compile:
    You need to mimic src/SessionExample.cpp to write a program to use the interface you need. After you've written it, run compile.sh to generate the executable.
    Use the following command to generate an executable file:
    ./compile.sh executable_file_name cpp_program_file_name
e.g.
    ./compile.sh Example src/SessionExample.cpp
